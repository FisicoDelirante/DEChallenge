Nobody knows?\rThat's right?\rShe wakes up when I sleep to talk to ghosts like in the movies."

Change is good sometimes. You know?\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nWhy would I change? I ain't never slide down a bad pole\n\nEven though I'm certified over plat's sold\n\nThey say I'm different 'cuz I ride in a plat. Rolls\n\nBut every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?\n\nI never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole\n\nAnd I aint givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold\n\nNo pride, I ain't that old\n\nCut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ??\n\nIt probably don't seem like a struggle\n\nBut I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle\n\nIt's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you\n\nIs beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you\n\nIt's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you\n\nIs prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you\n\nAnd people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you\n\nAnd goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThis game ain't change me, so don't let it change you\n\nIf you've been real with me, I'm still real with you\n\nIf you got love for me, I still got love for you\n\nIf you down for me, then I'm still down for you\n\nIf you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you\n\nIf you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you\n\nIf you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you\n\nThis game ain't change me, don't let it change you\n\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nWhy would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth\n\nTo remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth\n\nI'm speakin' the known truth\n\nI ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof\n\nWhy would I feel like I'm a stranger?\n\nAnd why should I feel like I'm in danger?\n\nAnd I'm grindin' 'till I'm right\n\nWhether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites\n\nI ain't blind from the limelite,\n\nI had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right\n\nPeople shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful\n\nBut fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full\n\nI'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed\n\nStayin, the same, like I'm, supposed\n\nGhetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler\n\nOne million customers, and I still bust at ya\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nWhy would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?\n\nI've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks\n\nKnown a few ?? and met a few locs\n\nMade a few comments, and said a few jokes\n\nBut it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine\n\nBefore the fame, the vibe was way better then\n\nSome have even became rivals instead of friends\n\nOnly two become liable for settlements\n\nI grew up watchin the\n\nNow they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz\n\nThat's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in\n\nThey know the family bring knives and barettas in\n\nI'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd\n\nHow could my head be in the clouds?\n\nIt's strange, what the fame'll do\n\nBut you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nI'm the same nigga man\n\nSame nigga, that ridin' with you\n\nNiggas that's fuckin' with you\n\nI'm still fuckin' with you niggas\n\nThe same nigga, these hoe's ain't like\n\nNow they on my dick right?

planted elsewhere\n\nOnly then will you obtain a wilderness\n\nThat cannot be penetrated, petrified family tree\n\n\n\nSee what started as a family forest\n\nGot cut to a family tree with the limbs\n\nAnd the leaves looking' at the world for answers\n\nThe world points to the sun and the sun says\n\n\n\nThe answers in me, so I search through the darkness\n\nCan't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost\n\nLord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me\n\nSo now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees\n\n\n\nMany minds always meet with pens and sheets\n\nClose my eyes, think what next on my rhymes\n\nSee this face in ink, I'm havin' visions of wisdom\n\nDreamin' 'bout my own ending\n\n\n\nAm I seein' death as freedom and livin' as prison\n\nMy son didn't have a daddy to shape him so\n\nGod bless him with a daddy to save him\n\nYeah I raise him and pay some attention\n\n\n\nHe talked and he listened to reach him and teach him\n\nBefore I'm gone from existence\n\nTeach him 'bout the foes, the hos and all opponents\n\nThose that always talk 'bout love but never showed it\n\n\n\nThose who had the chances to stand and always blowed it\n\nThose that set you up by the hour to steal your moment\n\nPac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor\n\nI'll get a pound of that shit from Bermuda\n\n\n\nAnd meet you in Cuba\n\nFucked up on Larusa no doubt, I know the locale\n\nIf they gotta born you, I'm gonna mourn you 'til I join you\n\n\n\nSee what started as a family forest\n\nGot cut to a family tree with the limbs\n\nAnd the leaves looking' at the world for answers\n\nThe world points to the sun and the sun says\n\n\n\nThe answers in me, so I search through the darkness\n\nCan't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost\n\nLord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me\n\nSo now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees\n\n\n\nUhh and now I know I got some family\n\nWho missed me from the heart, forever we're apart\n\nJust because I'm nothin' and you abuse me and use me\n\nNow you wanna try to come bruise me\n\n\n\nAnd even though maybe were in there\n\nFarther than it once was I know family don't always\n\nMean that they blood 'cause some people just\n\nDon't give a nigga what some people tried to use my name\n\n\n\nSo all the fat we had to cut and I'm still\n\nWalking with my six amp strut\n\nUrban eyes see through camouflage\n\nAnd now I know who's butt\n\n\n\nSo when I sent you tried to play me\n\nAll of a sudden now I'm shady\n\nMaybe deep down in my heart\n\nNever trust you from the start\n\n\n\nNever hoped you'd be my homie, don't come 'round my way\n\nAnd if we never speak again, it's got to be that way\n\nThis millennium, we'll be spankin' your heiny\n\nRemind thee naughty invented family of the 90's\n\n\n\nSee what started as a family forest\n\nGot cut to a family tree with the limbs\n\nAnd the leaves looking' at the world for answers\n\nThe world points to the sun and the sun says\n\n\n\nThe answers in me, so I search through the darkness\n\nCan't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost\n\nLord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me\n\nSo now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees\n\n\n\nLife doesn't end when the sweat dries\n\nA time when a nickle cost a dollar\n\nWhen you rise your chest dies\n\nMy dynasty many fear it 'cause' I'm near it\n\n\n\nAncient Egyptian scriptures fitted in through hieroglyphics\n\nMotherfuckers try to touch my mental state\n\nNiggas smile up in your face and then they infiltrate\n\nSo it seems nowadays that the only plan\n\n\n\nTo get my people help my people get a load of land\n\nAnd I'm'ma see it if I have to kill some shit\n\nTo make my family tree a motherfucking wilderness\n\nSee a black man standin' on the promised land\n\n\n\nSince they broke every promise I devised a plan this\n\nBlack this and black that crap is gettin' touchy\n\nAny black hat that cross my path, I call him lucky\n\nThose who turn. they back with they fears\n\n\n\nAnd try to before they can see us\n\nThey gonna need us sweet Jesus\n\n\n\nSee what started as a family forest\n\nGot cut to a family tree with the limbs\n\nAnd the leaves looking' at the world for answers\n\nThe world points to the sun and the sun says\n\n\n\nThe answers in me, so I search through the darkness\n\nCan't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost\n\nLord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me\n\nSo now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees\n\n\n\nSee what started as a family forest\n\nGot cut

MTV Raps\n\nA show, mainly for the black\n\nAnd still we can't ill, cause to them that's wrong\n\nCause like P.E. said, we're too black and too strong\n\nBut hey, what can I say\n\n(Brothers and sisters) that's a price a rapper must pay\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\n[Verse Two: PMD]\n\n\n\nAs airwaves collapse rap shows at a standstill\n\nSome racial circuits the frequencies can't handle\n\nThe funk tracks produced by EPMD\n\nBut it's a fat jam, that will never win a grammy\n\nUnless we sellout and kill the black movement dead\n\nWhich means swallow our pride and become flunkies instead\n\nAnd stop the rap about freedom, thoughts of a black president\n\nAnd rap about a black crack, the mayor in our residence\n\nGive me a break brothers, it's time to take a stand\n\nAnd kill that no sir, yes sir, and thank you ma'am\n\nCuz the word is a luxury a black man can't afford\n\nThat's why poverty's on the rise and we still ignored\n\nAnd it's a setback and yet the clock still ticks\n\nAnd if we let it, rap would be run by politics\n\nI read it somewhere that every man's created equal\n\nBut not in this day and age, maybe in the sequel\n\nWhich means next time, so observe these rhymes\n\nAnd take a stand and go for yours cause I'm going for mine\n\nThat's why I\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\n[Verse Three: Erick Sermon, PMD]\n\n\n\nWhy is that when wrong is done by the black\n\nIt's blown out of proportion and immediately attacked\n\nBy the press and yes, conflict is caused\n\nBy the kids at concerts who bumrush the doors\n\nOne child gets hurt, the press gets pesty\n\nBut what about the Beatles, G, and Elvis Presley\n\nSame stuff was rough, rap does not cause violence\n\nSo (Fight the Power) and make them understand\n\nBut too much power and you might get banned\n\nSo if you want airplay\n\nYou can't be too black and hey, watch what you say, but ayo\n\n\n\n[Chorus: to fade]"

Sass until the next day\n\nFuck Key Largo take me back to the X-Ray\n\n\n\nTake me back to the X-Ray\n\n\n\nMy fingers are frozen my coat is soaked through\n\nMy toes are past numb we've got a hundred more to do\n\nThey're only getting wetter got to get another up\n\nLuke loads the stapler then he slaps the hammer shut\n\n\n\nTack tack tack down the right then the left side\n\nIf you see Five-O then you'd better step hide\n\nWait until they pass and come around the block again\n\nTime to go back to work before this late night ends\n\n\n\nOver on my left he's holding up another poster\n\nPushing up the corner as the staple falls close to\n\nHis index finger as his breath lingers in the air\n\nWater trickles up his arm he doesn't seem to care\n\n\n\nHe doesn't wear gloves they make it hard to grab the paper\n\nOn a late night caper with a state of the art stapler\n\nDamn it's getting cold but still we've got to pass the word\n\nPlastering the poles from Hawthorne to twenty third\n\n\n\nBut not in front of Fred's or Crocodile they'll tear them down\n\nAnd never cover the X-Ray's 'cause they support the sound\n\nLuke will tack it back if it belongs to a friend\n\nBut if you cover his you'll never see your shit again so watch your\n\n\n\nPosters...\n\n\n\nHere we go again after the show again I've got to hit the\n\nStreets work my feet and get my flow again\n\nAll alone and then I feel the pavement on my aching feet\n\nDawn will come before this trip's complete\n\n\n\nConcrete and light rain stain the city I was born in\n\nI hardly feel alive as the horizon whispers morning\n\nWalking on train tracks from halls where the name's at\n\nI wanted to clear my head but once again all of the pain's back\n\n\n\nI'm torn between the place I'm in and where I want to be\n\nFaith won't wait kid so what's it gonna be\n\nForget it and let it go take no as the answer\n\nOr if you choose to do it better get serious as cancer\n\n\n\nBut see I took a peek and looked deep into it\n\nAnd after what I saw I'm not so sure I should pursue it\n\nStill I know a half-step is likely to be my last step\n\nAnd playing live beats nine to fives so thrive or hit the casket"

My conscience is my only means of direction. \n\nDid I sign up for suicide, or a saddened bride? \n\nThree more years, no white picket fencing, suffering a mental conviction. \n\nPlease, don't you think that now we will look down \n\non a man who's realized what's true to him now? \n\nIt's not giving up, it's seeing what else there's to see. \n\nWhen you're soon set free, there is so much more than a camouflaged hell. \n\nSO COCK THE GUN AND FIRE INTO THE EYES OF A GREAT DESIRE.\n\nA fleeting destiny has turned into what's considered to be normal. \n\nAnd I'm here for you."
